# OSCope, the OSC Scope

This is a command line utility for sending and receiving [Open Sound Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control) messages. This can be useful for debugging and testing.

It's currently in an alpha releaseâ€”it should improve substantially very soon.

## Installation

You can use it two ways. Both require you to have Node.js installed.

If you want to install the tool so you can have it available in your path, run:

```bash
npm install -g oscope

#Then run it with
oscope <command> [options...]
```

A simpler solution is to run it with NPX like so:

```bash
npx oscope <command> [options...]
```
